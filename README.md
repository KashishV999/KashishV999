# 👋 Hi there! I'm Kashish Verma

🌱 I’m a second-year **Computer Science** student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and a knack for creativity. I believe technology is a powerful tool, and I love transforming ideas into functional, impactful solutions. My journey has taken me through various programming languages and frameworks, each adding a new brushstroke to my skill set. Whether it’s building a software solution, optimizing processes, or managing data, I thrive on challenges that push me to think outside the box.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📚 Library Management System
Managing a library can be as easy as pie—or at least close enough! Using **C++** and **Object-Oriented principles**, I developed **SmartLib**, a streamlined library management system with a command-line interface. From returns and loans to tracking due dates, this system manages publications and books with the simplicity of a professional librarian. With file handling for persistent storage, your library data is safe and secure, ready to keep track of all your favorite reads! 

### 🎶 MelodyMix - Music Web App
Unleash your inner DJ with **MelodyMix**, a dynamic music app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This web app lets you explore artist albums and play songs with a single click. Want to add a new artist? Fill out the form, and voila—it’s added to the mix! It’s like a virtual concert, minus the ticket prices and bad acoustics. 🎤🎧
