## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📚 Library Management System
Ever thought managing a library was as easy as pie? Well, I built a C++ library system that makes it almost that easy (no baking required)! Using Object-Oriented principles, I crafted a slick command-line interface that helps manage publications and books like a pro librarian. With file handling for persistent storage, you won’t lose track of your favorite reads! So whether you're returning a book, checking out the latest bestsellers, or keeping an eye on due dates, this system has got your back!

### 🎶 Music Web App
Imagine a web app where you can unleash your inner DJ—well, that’s what I built! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my dynamic web app showcases artist albums and lets you play songs with a simple click. Want to add a new artist? Just fill out the form, and watch the magic happen! It’s like a concert in your browser, minus the ticket fees and bad acoustics. 🎤🎧

## 📚 A Bit About Me
I have a serious love for fictional books, especially those desi romantic novels that make you laugh, cry, and roll your eyes at the same time. It's a guilty pleasure I can’t resist—who knew fictional heartbreak could be so entertaining?
